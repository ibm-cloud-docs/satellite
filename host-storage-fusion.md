## I added hosts to my location, what's next?
{: #fusion-whats-next-host}

Now that you added hosts to your location, you can assign them to your location control plane or to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
{: shortdesc}

1. Assign [hosts to the location control plane](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-control-plane) or [to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-assigning-hosts).
2. Create a [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-managed-services), such as a [{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-satellite-clusters). You can even [register existing {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} clusters to your location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-register-openshift-clusters) to use as deployment targets.
3. [Manage your applications](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-cluster-config) with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config.
4. Create [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cluster storage templates](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-template-ov).
5. Learn more about the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link component](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloud) and how you can use endpoints to manage the network traffic between your location and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
