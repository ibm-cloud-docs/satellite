- Make sure that your command-line tools are up to date.
    - In the terminal, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up to date so that you can use all available commands and flags.
    - Make sure that your `kubectl` and `oc` CLI client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).
- Keep the clusters and hosts in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location up to date.
- Enable and review [logging](#review-logs) and [monitoring](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-monitor) details to troubleshoot your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} components.

## Identifying issues for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service
{: #help-services}

If you experience an issue with a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service in your location, first check whether your issue is listed in the troubleshooting topics in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} documentation. If the issue is not listed in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} documentation, check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} documentation set for the service.

For example, if you cannot access the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} console for a {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster on {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}, first check whether the issue is [specific to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location setup](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-console-fail). If your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location setup is not the source of the issue, then check the [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} documentation for troubleshooting console issues](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ocp-debug).

## Reviewing logs
