# Default Link endpoints for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location
{: #default-link-endpoints}

Find information about default Link endpoints for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access to your {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} location.

## Default link endpoints for CoreOS enabled locations
{: #rhcos-default-endpoints}

Default endpoints are created for your location's control plane cluster and for any other {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled services that you run in your location. These endpoints are accessible only from within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.
{: shortdesc}

The following table describes the Link endpoints that are automatically created in your Red Hat CoreOS enabled location.
