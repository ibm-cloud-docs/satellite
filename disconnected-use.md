# Disconnected use for Satellite components 
{: #disconnected-use}

Certain features of {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} can be used while disconnected temporarily. See the following FAQs to understand the disconnected use for these components.
{: shortdesc}

## Understanding disconnected usage
{: #understand-disconnected}

What does disconnected usage mean?
:   When {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Locations and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} are disconnected from the parent `managed-from` region in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, they can still run with some limitations for a certain amount of time. The limitations of disconnected usage include no security fixes and no alerts. For more information, see [Disconnected usage by component](#disconnect-usage-component).

How do I set how long my access token is valid for?
:   Edit the value of the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` parameter to set the token validity in seconds. For more information, see [Setting the disconnected usage time](#disconnect-time). 

What happens when my token expires?
:   After your token expires, you lose the ability to work with the Location. When you run a command, you get error messages such as `error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)`. To recover, you must reconnect to the Location and log in again to retrieve a new token. Do not reload nodes before the Location is reconnected. If you reload nodes while the Location is disconnected, the location won't recover. 

Do I need to re-create the Location?
:   No, you don't need to re-create the Location. You can reconnect the existing Location and re-authenticate to continue working with your Location.

How do I re-authenticate? 
:   Reconnect your Location first and then log in again with your credentials. 

Do I have to recover etcd backup?
:   If you are using RHCOS hosts, you don't need to recover etcd backup. The Location recovers automatically after you reconnect it and re-authenticate. However, locations that use RHEL might need to recover etcd.

What happens if a location stays disconnected for more than 7 days?
:   After you restore your connection, you might need to replace all hosts across the location with new infrastructure.

How do I know when to reconnect a location?
:   You can make a note or set a reminder to reconnect the location before the 7-day window expires. The timer starts when you request the token. 

## Setting the disconnected usage time
{: #disconnect-time}

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Locations and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} can run disconnected from the parent `managed-from` region in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for up to 168 hours (7 days).
{: shortdesc}

You can modify this setting by changing the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value for all your OAuth clients. The default value for `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` parameter is 86400 seconds.

The `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value starts counting when the user was last authenticated, not when the Location is disconnected. Note that a user must have access to IAM to authenticate.

1. Get your OAuth clients by running `oc get oauthclients`.

    ```sh
    NAME                           SECRET                                        WWW-CHALLENGE   TOKEN-MAX-AGE   REDIRECT URIS

    ```
    {: screen}


2. Get your OAuth access tokens by running `oc get oauthaccesstokens`.

3. For each OAuth client that you retrieved in step 1, set the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value by running `oc  edit oauthclients console` and adding the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 604800` as the first line. Note that you must repeat this step for all your OAuth clients.

4. Optionally, run `oc get oauthclients console -o yaml` to check whether the first line of the yaml file was updated to `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 604800`.

5. Refresh your cluster by running `ibmcloud ks cluster master refresh --cluster CLUSTERID` for the changes to take effect.

6. Run the following command to verify that the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value was updated for your OAuth clients.
    ```sh
    oc get oauthclients -o json | jq -j '.items[]|"Name:\t", .metadata.name, "\t", "value:\t", .accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds, "\n"'
    ```
