# {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver
{: #storage-ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver}

The {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} Container Storage Interface (CSI) [Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver){: external} in {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} allows you to manage the lifecycle of your IBM VPC Block Data volumes.

The template is currently in beta. Do not use it for production workloads. 
{: beta}


Before you can deploy storage templates to clusters in your location, make sure you set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config by selecting the **Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config** option in the console or including the `--enable-config-admin` option when you create your cluster.
{: important}

You cannot scope {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage service to resource groups. However, if you are scoping other resources such as location and cluster to resource groups, you need to add {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reader and link administrator role for all resources in the account.
{: note}

## Prerequisites for {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}
{: #sat-storage-vpc-csi-prereq}

## Deploying an app that uses {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}
{: #sat-storage-vpc-deploy-app}


You can use the `ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver` to create PVCs that you can use in your cluster workloads.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a PVC that references a VPC storage class that you created earlier.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: my-pvc
    spec:
      storageClassName: ibmc-vpc-block-5iops-tier
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi

    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Create the PVC in your cluster. 

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. 

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-deployment
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels: 
        app: my-app
      template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: my-app
        spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-container
            image: ngnix
        volumeMounts:
            name: my-volume
            mountPath: /mount-path
        volumes:
            name: my-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim: null
            claimName: my-pvc
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    my-deployment                       1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

    ```sh
    oc exec my-deployment
    ```
    {: pre}

1. View the contents of the `outfile` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.

    ```sh
    cat /
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    
    ```sh
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Exit the pod.

    ```sh
    exit
    ```
    {: pre}

## Removing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage from your apps
