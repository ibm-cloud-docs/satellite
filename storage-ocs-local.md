# OpenShift Data Foundation using local disks
{: #config-storage-ocs-local}

Set up OpenShift Data Foundationfor {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters. You can use {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage templates to create storage configurations. When you assign a storage configuration to your clusters, the storage drivers of the selected storage provider are installed in your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

OpenShift Data Foundation is available in only internal mode, which means that your apps run in the same cluster as your storage. External mode, or storage heavy configurations, where your storage is located in a separate cluster from your apps is not supported.
{: note}


## Prerequisites
{: #sat-storage-ocs-local-prereq}

To use the ODF storage with the local storage operator and local storage devices, complete the following tasks:

- [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations).
- [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cluster](/docs/satellite?topic=openshift-satellite-clusters).
    - Your cluster must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes with at least 16CPUs and 64GB RAM per worker node.
    - Your hosts must meet the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} host requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs) in addition to having one of the following local storage configurations.
        * Two extra raw devices per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirments. These disks must not be partitioned or formatted file systems. If your devices are not partitioned, each node must have 2 free disks. One disk for the OSD and one disk for the MON.
        * Two extra raw partitions per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirements. These disks must not be  formatted file systems. If your raw devices are partitioned, they must have at least 2 partitions per disk, per worker node.
- [Add your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} to a cluster group](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-clusters-satconfig#setup-clusters-satconfig-groups).
- [Set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config on your clusters](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satcon-create).
- [Set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloud#link-about).
- **Optional**: If you want to use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} as your object service, [Create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} service instance](#sat-storage-ocs-local-cos) and HMAC credentials. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance that you create is used as the NooBaa backing store in your ODF configuration. The backing store is the underlying storage for the data in your NooBaa buckets. If you do not specify an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance when you create your storage configuration, the default NooBaa backing store is configured. You can create additional backing stores, including {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing stores after your storage configuration is assigned to your clusters and ODF is installed.
- [Get the details of the raw, unformatted devices that you want to use for your configuration](#sat-storage-ocs-local-devices). The device IDs of your storage disks are used to create your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage configuration.


## Optional: Setting up an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing store
{: #sat-storage-ocs-local-cos}

If you want to use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} as your object service, create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} service instance and HMAC credentials. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance that you create is used as the NooBaa backing store in your ODF configuration. The backing store is the underlying storage for the data in your NooBaa buckets. If you do not specify an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance when you create your storage configuration, the default NooBaa backing store is configured. You can create additional backing stores, including {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing stores after your storage configuration is assigned to your clusters and ODF is installed.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create noobaa-store cloud-object-storage standard global
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Create HMAC credentials and note the service access key and access key ID of your HMAC credentials.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-key-create cos-cred-rw Writer --instance-name noobaa-store --parameters '{"HMAC": true}'
    ```
    {: pre}

## Creating a secret that contains your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link credentials
{: #odf-sat-link-local}

Before you install ODF, create a Kubernetes secret with your link credentials.
{: shortdesc}

1. Get the details of your `satellite-containersApi` endpoint.
    1. From the {[sat-console]} select the location where you want to deploy ODF.
    2. Click **Link endpoints**, then click the `satellite-containersApi` endpoint.
    3. On the Endpoint details page, copy the endpoint.
1. List the secrets in the `kube-system` namespace of your cluster and look for the `storage-secret-store`.

    ```sh
    oc get secrets -n kube-system | grep storage-secret-store
    ```
    {: pre}

1. If the `storage-secret-store` secret doesn't exist, create it.

    1. Create a `secret.yaml` file that contains your IAM API key and the link endpoint you retrieved earlier.

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: storage-secret-store
          namespace: kube-system
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          slclient.toml: |-
            [Bluemix]
              iam_url = "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com"
              iam_client_id = "bx"
              iam_client_secret = "bx"
              iam_api_key = "<iam_api_key>" # Enter your IAM API key
              containers_api_route_private = "<link_endpoint>" # Enter the link endpoint that you retrieved earlier.
            [VPC]
              provider_type = "g2"
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    1. Create the secret in your cluster. 

        ```sh
        oc create -f secret.yaml -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

1. If the `storage-secret-store` secret exists, update it.

    1. Edit the `storage-secret-store` secret.

        ```sh
        oc edit secret storage-secret-store -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: storage-secret-store
          namespace: kube-system
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          slclient.toml: |-
            [Bluemix]
              iam_url = "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com"
              iam_client_id = "bx"
              iam_client_secret = "bx"
              iam_api_key = "<iam_api_key>" # Enter your IAM API key
              containers_api_route_private = "<link_endpoint>" # Enter the link endpoint that you created earlier.
            [VPC]
              provider_type = "g2"
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    1. Save and close the file to apply the secret to your cluster.


## Getting the device details for your ODF configuration
{: #sat-storage-ocs-local-devices}

When you create your ODF configuration, you must specify the device paths of the disks that you want to use in your storage cluster. The storage cluster is comprised of the object storage daemon (OSD) pods and the monitoring (MON) pods. The devices that you specify as OSD devices are your storage devices where your app data is stored and the devices that you specify as MON devices are managed by the MON pod and used to store and maintain the storage cluster mapping and monitor storage events. For more information about the OSD and MON, see the [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/start/intro/){: external}.

The following steps show how you can manually retrieve the local device information from each worker node in your clusters. You can also use the [ODF disk gatherer](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4928841) to retrieve a list of all the local devices in your cluster.
{: tip}

1. Log in to your cluster and get a list of available worker nodes. Make a note of the worker nodes that you want to use in your ODF configuration.

    ```sh
    oc get nodes
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Log in to each worker node that you want to use for your ODF configuration.

    ```sh
    oc debug node/<node-name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. When the debug pod is deployed on the worker node, run the following commands to list the available disks on the worker node.

    1. Allow host binaries.
    
        ```sh
        chroot /host
        ```
        {: pre}

    1. List your devices.
    
        ```sh
        lsblk
        ```
        {: pre}

4. Review the command output for available disks. Disks that can be used for your ODF configuration must be unmounted. In the following example output from the `lsblk` command, the `sdc` disk has two available, unformatted partitions that you can use for the OSD and MON device paths for this worker node. If your worker node has raw disks without partitions, you need one disk for the OSD and one disk for the MON. As a best practice, and to maximize storage capacity on this disk, you can specify the smaller partition or disk for the MON, and the larger partition or disk for the OSD. Note that the initial storage capacity of your ODF configuration is equal to the size of the disk that you specify as the `osd-device-path` when you create your configuration.


    ```sh
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0   931G  0 disk
    |-sda1   8:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
    |-sda2   8:2    0     1G  0 part
    `-sda3   8:3    0 929.8G  0 part /
    sdb      8:16   0 744.7G  0 disk
    `-sdb1   8:17   0 744.7G  0 part /disk1
    sdc      8:32   0 744.7G  0 disk
    |-sdc1   8:33   0  18.6G  0 part
    `-sdc2   8:34   0 260.8G  0 part
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Find the `by-id` for each disk that you want to use in your configuration. In this case, the `sdc1` and `sdc2` partitions are unformatted and unmounted. The `by-id` for each disk is specified as a command parameter when you create your configuration.

    ```sh
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    If you have VMware hosts, run the following command.
    
    ```sh
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    

6. Review the command output and make a note of the `by-id` values for the disks that you want to use in your configuration. In the following example output, the disk ids for the `sdc1` and `sdc2` partitions are: `scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part1` and `scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part2`.
    ```sh
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root  9 Feb  9 04:15 scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bbb603150cc6 -> ../../sda

7. Repeat the previous steps for each worker node that you want to use for your ODF configuration.   









## Creating an OpenShift Data Foundation configuration in the command line
{: #sat-storage-ocs-local-cli}

1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

1. List your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations and note the `Managed from` column.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat location ls
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Target the `Managed from` region of your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. For example, for `wdc` target `us-east`. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} regions](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-sat-regions).

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -r us-east
    ```
    {: pre}

1. If you use a resource group other than `default`, target it.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -g <resource-group>
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. List the available templates and versions and review the output. Make a note of the template and version that you want to use.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage template ls
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. Review the [Red Hat OpenShift container storage configuration parameters](#sat-storage-ocs-local-params-cli).
1. Copy the following command and replace the variables with the parameters for your storage configuration. You can pass additional parameters by using the `--param "key=value"` format. For more information, see the `ibmcloud sat storage config create --name` [command](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satellite-cli-reference#cli-storage-config-create). Be sure to include the `/dev/disk/by-id/` prefix for your `mon-device-path` and `osd-device-path` values. If you are using a {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} backing store, be sure to specify the regional public endpoint in the following format: `https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`. Don't specify the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} parameters if your existing configuration doesn't use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

    Note that you must specify separate disks or separate partitions for each `mon-device-path` and `osd-device-path`. You must assign one disk or one partition for each OSD or MON storage device. For disks without partitions, specify separate disks. For partitioned disks, you can specify the same disk, but you must specify separate partitions.
    {: note}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage config create --name <config_name> --location <location> --template-name odf-local --template-version <template_version> -p "ocs-cluster-name=<ocs-cluster-name" -p "osd-device-path=/dev/disk/by-id/<device-1>,/dev/disk/by-id/<device-2>,/dev/disk/by-id/<device-3>" -p "mon-device-path=/dev/disk/by-id/<device-1>,/dev/disk/by-id/<device-2>,/dev/disk/by-id/<device-3>" -p "num-of-osd=1" -p "worker-nodes=<worker-node-IP>,<worker-node-IP>,<worker-node-IP>" -p "ibm-cos-endpoint=<ibm-cos-endpoint>" -p "ibm-cos-location=<ibm-cos-location>" -p "ibm-cos-access-key=<ibm-cos-access-key>" -p "ibm-cos-secret-key=<ibm-cos-secret-key>" -p "container-private-endpoint=<link-endpoint>" -p "iam-api-key=<iam-api-key>"

    ```
    {: pre}

1. [Assign your storage configuration to clusters](#assign-storage-ocs-local).


## Assigning your ODF storage configuration to a cluster
{: #assign-storage-ocs-local}

After you [create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage configuration](#config-storage-ocs-local), you can assign you configuration to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters.





1. List your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage configurations and make a note of the storage configuration that you want to assign to your clusters.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage config ls
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Get the ID of the cluster or cluster group that you want to assign storage to. To make sure that your cluster is registered with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config or to create groups, see [Setting up clusters to use with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-clusters-satconfig).

## Deploying an app that uses OpenShift Data Foundation
{: #sat-storage-ocs-local-deploy}

You can use the ODF storage classes to create PVCs for the apps in your clusters.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV, you must use the same values for the storage class and the size of the storage.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: ocs-pvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      storageClassName: sat-ocs-cephfs-gold
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 5Gi
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Create the PVC in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. The following example creates an `nginx` pod that writes the current date and time to a `test.txt` file.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /test/test.txt; sleep 5; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: persistent-storage
          mountPath: /test
      volumes:
      - name: persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: ocs-pvc
    ```
    {: codeblock}

4. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app                                 1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

6. Verify that the app can write data.

    1. Log in to your pod.
    
        ```sh
        oc exec <app-pod-name> -it bash
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Display the contents of the `test.txt` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.
    
        ```sh
        cat /test/test.txt
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:19 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:25 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:31 UTC 2021

        Tue Mar 2 20:09:42 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:47 UTC 2021
        ```
        {: screen}

    3. Exit the pod.
    
        ```sh
        exit
        ```

## Upgrading your ODF version
{: #ocs-local-upgrade}

To upgrade the ODF version of your configuration, get the details of your configuration and create a new configuration with the same `ocs-cluster-name` and details, but with the `template-version` set to the target version that you want to upgrade to and the `ocs-upgrade` parameter to `true`.
{: shortdesc}

Deleting configurations and assignments might result in data loss.
{: important}

In the following example, the ODF configuration is updated to use template version 4.7,
- `--name` - Enter a name for your new configuration.
- `--template-name` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `--template-version` - Enter the template version that you want to use to upgrade your configuration.
- `ocs-cluster-name` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `osd-device-path` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `mon-device-path` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `num-of-osd` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `container-private-endpoint` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `worker-nodes` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `ocs-upgrade` - Enter `true` to upgrade your `ocs-cluster` to the template version that you specified.
- `ibm-cos-access-key` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this paramter if you do not use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-secret-access-key` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this paramter if you do not use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-endpoint` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this paramter if you do not use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-location` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this paramter if you do not use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.


1. Get the details of your ODF configuration.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage config get --config <config>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Get the configuration details of your `ocscluster` custom resource.

    ```sh
    oc get ocscluster <ocs-cluster-name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Save the configuration details. When you upgrade your ODF version, you must enter the same configuration details as in your existing ODF configuration. In addition, you must set the `template-version` to the version you want to upgrade to and change the `ocs-upgrade` parameter to `true`. Do not specify the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} parameters when you create your configuration if you do not use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration. Note that Kubernetes resouces can't contain capital letters or special characters. Enter an `ocs-cluster-name` that uses only lowercase letters, numbers, `-`, or `.`.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage config create --name <config_name> --location <location> --template-name odf-local --template-version <template_version> -p "ocs-cluster-name=testocscluster" -p "osd-device-path=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part2,/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bbf306bc28a7-part2,/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600062b206ba6f00276eb58065b5da94-part2" -p "mon-device-path=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part1,/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bbf306bc28a7-part1,/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600062b206ba6f00276eb58065b5da94-part1" -p "num-of-osd=1" -p "worker-nodes=<worker-IP>,<worker-IP>,<worker-IP>" -p "ocs-upgrade=true" -p "ibm-cos-endpoint=<ibm-cos-endpoint>" -p "ibm-cos-location=<ibm-cos-location>" -p "ibm-cos-access-key=<ibm-cos-access-key>" -p "ibm-cos-secret-key=<ibm-cos-secret-key>" -p "container-private-endpoint=<link-endpoint>"
    ```

## Removing OpenShift Data Foundation from your apps
{: #ocs-local-rm}

If you no longer need your OpenShift Data Foundation, you can remove your PVC, PV, and the ODF operator from your clusters.
{: shortdesc}

1. List your PVCs and note the name of the PVC and the corresponding PV that you want to remove.
    ```sh
    oc get pvc
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Remove any pods that mount the PVC.
    1. List all the pods that currently mount the PVC that you want to delete. If no pods are returned, you do not have any pods that currently use your PVC.
        ```sh
        oc get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"

        {: screen}

    2. Remove the pod that uses the PVC. If the pod is part of a deployment, remove the deployment.
        ```sh
        oc delete pod <pod_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```sh
        oc delete deployment <deployment_name>

## Removing the ODF local storage configuration from your cluster
{: #ocs-local-template-rm}

If you no longer plan to use OpenShift Data Foundation in your cluster, you can unassign your cluster from the storage configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Removing the storage configuration uninstalls the ODF operators from all assigned clusters. Your PVCs, PVs, and data are not removed. However, you might not be able to access your data until you re-install the driver in your cluster again.
{: important}


1. List your storage assignments and find the one that you used for your cluster.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment ls (--cluster <cluster_id> | --service-cluster-id <cluster_id>)
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Remove the assignment. After the assignment is removed, the ODF driver pods and storage classes are removed from all clusters that were part of the storage assignment.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. List your storage assignments and find the one that you used for your cluster.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment ls (--cluster <cluster_id> | --service-cluster-id <cluster_id>)
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Remove the assignment. After the assignment is removed, the local file driver pods and storage classes are removed from all clusters that were part of the storage assignment.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Remove your storage assignment.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment>
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Clean up the remaining Kubernetes resources from your cluster. Save the following script in a file called `cleanup.sh` to your local machine.
    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash
    ocscluster_name=`oc get ocscluster | awk 'NR==2 {print $1}'`
    oc delete ocscluster --all --wait=false

    ```
    {: codeblock}

7. Run the `cleanup.sh` script.

    ```sh
    sh ./cleanup.sh
    ```
    {: pre}

8. After you run the cleanup script, log in to each worker node and run the following commands.

    1. Deploy a debug pod and run `chroot /host`.
    
        ```bash
        oc debug node/<node_name> -- chroot /host
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Run the following command to remove any files or directories on the specified paths. Repeat this step for each worker node that you used in your ODF configuration.
        ```bash
        rm -rvf /var/lib/rook /mnt/local-storage
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        Example output
        
        ```sh
        removed '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/log/ocs-deviceset-0-data-0-6fgp6/ceph-volume.log'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/log/ocs-deviceset-0-data-0-6fgp6'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/log'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/crash/posted'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/crash'
        removed '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/client.admin.keyring'
        removed '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage/openshift-storage.config'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook/openshift-storage'
        removed directory: '/var/lib/rook'
        removed '/mnt/local-storage/localblock/nvme3n1'
        removed directory: '/mnt/local-storage/localblock'
        removed '/mnt/local-storage/localfile/nvme2n1'
        removed directory: '/mnt/local-storage/localfile'
        removed directory: '/mnt/local-storage'
        ```
        {: screen}


9. **Optional**: If you no longer want to use the local volumes that you used in your ODF configuration, you can delete them from the cluster. List the local PVs.

    ```sh
    oc get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    local-pv-180cfc58   139Gi      RWO            Delete           Available           localfile               11m

    local-pv-80c5166    100Gi      RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              12m
    local-pv-9b049705   139Gi      RWO            Delete           Available           localfile               12m
    local-pv-b09e0279   100Gi      RWO            Delete           Available           localblock              12m

    ```
    {: screen}

10. Delete the local PVs.

    ```sh
    oc delete pv <pv_name> <pv_name> <pv_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

11. List the ODF and local storage classes.

    ```sh
    oc get sc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    localblock                    kubernetes.io/no-provisioner            Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  42m
    localfile                     kubernetes.io/no-provisioner            Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  42m
    ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com      Delete          Immediate              true                   41m
    ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw   openshift-storage.ceph.rook.io/bucket   Delete          Immediate              false                  41m
    ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
    ```
    {: screen}

12. Delete the storage classes.

    ```sh
    oc delete sc localblock localfile ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io "localblock" deleted
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io "localfile" deleted
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io "ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw" deleted
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io "ocs-storagecluster-cephfs" deleted
